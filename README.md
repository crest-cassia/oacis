## What is OACIS?

*OACIS* (''Organizing Assistant for Comprehensive and Interactive Simulations'') is a **job management software** for large scale simulations.

As the number of simulation jobs increases, it is often difficult to keep track of vast and various simulation results in an organized way.

OACIS is a job management software aiming at overcoming these difficulties.
With a user-friendly interface of OACIS, you can easily submit various jobs to appropriate remote hosts.
After these jobs are finished, all the result files are automatically downloaded from the remote hosts and stored in a traceable way together with logs of the date, host, and elapsed time of the jobs.
It also provides APIs, which helps us automate parameter sweep, optimization of parameters, and sensitivity analysis etc.

If you have a trouble of handling many simulation jobs, OACIS will definitely help you!

## A sample of APIs

A small sample of parameter sweep over parameters "p1" and "p2" of your simulator.
See http://crest-cassia.github.io/oacis/en/api.html for more details.
OACIS has both Ruby and Python APIs.

```ruby
sim = Simulator.where(name: "my_simulator").first

p1_values = [1.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,5.0]                                         # a standard way to make an array
p2_values = [2.0,4.0,6.0,8.0,10.0]
base_param = sim.default_parameters                                  # => {"p1"=>1.0, "p2"=>2.0, "p3"=>3.0}

host = Host.where(name: "localhost").first
host_param = host.default_host_parameters

# We are going to fix the parameters other than "p1" and "p2"
p1_values.each do |p1|                  # iterate over p1
  p2_values.each do |p2|                # iterate over p2
    param = base_param.merge({"p1"=>p1,"p2"=>p2})           #   => {"p1"=>p1, "p2"=>p2, "p3"=>3.0}
    ps = sim.find_or_create_parameter_set( param )          #   => ParameterSet of the given parameters
    runs = ps.find_or_create_runs_upto(5, submitted_to: host, host_param: host_param)  # creating runs under given parameter sets
  end
end
```
