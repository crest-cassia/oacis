## Backup and Restore

OACIS manages data both on MongoDB and on file system. In order to make a backup of the data, we need to save both of them.
We are going to explain how to make a backup of the data managed by OACIS.

### If you are NOT using Docker

#### Backup

First, run the following command in order to make a backup of MongoDB. The dumped files are created in *"dump"* directory. Make a backup of this directory.

{% highlight sh %}
mongodump --db oacis_development
{% endhighlight %}

Second, we need to make a backup of the files in the file system. All the files are stored in **"OACIS_PROJECT_ROOT/public/Result_development"** directory, where *"OACIS_PROJECT_ROOT"* is the directory where the source code of OACIS is cloned.
To make a backup of the directory, run the following command for example.
(Although you can simply use `cp` command, we recommend `rsync` if you have a large amount of files.)

{% highlight sh %}
rsync -av -P --delete /path/to/OACIS/public/Result_development /backup_dir
{% endhighlight %}

#### Restore

Run the following command. Please replace the path of the second line depending on the actual path.

{% highlight sh %}
mongo  oacis_development --eval 'db.dropDatabase();'
mongorestore --db oacis_development #{path to your dump file, e.g. /path/to/DB_data/dump/oacis_development}
{% endhighlight %}

(Warning) The above command is deleting the existing record once. In other words, the old documents are overwritten.

To restore the files in the file system, use `rsync` command as follows. Please replace with your actual path.

{% highlight sh %}
rsync -av -P --delete /backup_dir/Result_development /path/to/OACIS/public
{% endhighlight %}

### If you are using Docker

Refer to [Backup and Restore](https://github.com/crest-cassia/oacis_docker/blob/master/README.md#backup-and-restore).

## READ_ONLY mode


If you would like to share your results with a person in a distant place, you can launch another OACIS in a public (cloud) server and sync the results in your local OACIS to the public one.
In that case, it is safe to prohibit job submission on the public OACIS. Otherwise, a malicious user can, in principle, execute any command on the computational host.
In order to prevent job submissions, OACIS provides *"Read Only"* mode. With *"Read Only"* mode, any modification on the data, including the job submission, is prohibited.

In order to enable Read-Only mode, make a file *"config/user_config.yml"* in the directory where the source code of OACIS exists.
You can find a sample file *"config/user_config.sample.yml"*.
To enable Read-Only mode, edit the configuration file as follows and restart OACIS.

{% highlight yaml %}
---
read_only: true
{% endhighlight %}

With this setting, the worker process is not launched, and any modification from web browsers become impossible.

We recommend to periodically synchronize the files of the public OACIS server with your local OACIS server where actual simulations are conducted.
