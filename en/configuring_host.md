## How a job is submitted to a computational host

Generally speaking, we need to use a job scheduler, such as Torque, to submit a job to High-Performance Computers (HPCs) or CPU clusters.
When submitting a job to a job scheduler, we usually need to specify various parameters such as the number of nodes required for the job, the maximum elapsed time, and the number of CPU cores.

The problem is that the specifications of these job schedulers are different from each other, showing a wide variety.
Therefore, OACIS uses a small script, called [XSUB](https://github.com/crest-cassia/xsub) to absorb the difference between schedulers.
XSUB must be prepared in the computational hosts before you register the host information on OACIS.

About the installation procedure of XSUB, please refer to the [official document](https://github.com/crest-cassia/xsub).
After you install XSUB properly, the commands **xsub**, **xstat**, and **xdel** became available.

(Note) OACIS runs these command from bash launched as a login-shell. Therefore, please set the environment variables required to use XSUB, such as PATH, in `.bash_profile` file, not in `.bashrc`.

The parameters required to specify when submitting a job are called **"host parameters"**.
Required host parameters are different depending on the specification of the job schedulers. OACIS retrieves the information of the required host parameters using the "xsub" command.
Hence, XSUB must be setup before registering the host information on OACIS.
When you create a run, fields for the host parameters are shown in the page as shown in the figure below.

## Specification of Host {#host_specification}

We will explain the list of information which you need to specify when registering a host.

|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| field                      | explanation                                                         |
|:---------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Name                       | The name used in OACIS. You can specify an arbitrary string. Must be unique. |
| Hostname                   | hostname or IP address used as the destination of the SSH connection |
| Polling Status             | A switch controlling if you are going to use this host. When you would like to stop the submission temporarily, maybe due to maintenance of the server, set this field to "disabled". |
| User                       | User name used for ssh connection. |
| Port                       | Port used for SSH connection. Default value is 22. |
| SSH key                    | SSH authentication key used for SSH connection. Default is *~/.ssh/id_rsa* |
| Work base dir              | The path to the work directory. The work directory is the place where jobs are executed. Please specify the directory dedicated to OACIS jobs. |
| Mounted work base dir      | If the work base dir is directly accessible from OACIS, specify the path which is accessible from OACIS. See the notes below this table.|
| Max num jobs               | The maximum number of concurrent jobs. Jobs are queued until the number of running jobs becomes this number. |
| Polling interval           | Time interval to check the status of the computational host. With this interval, SSH connection is made to check the status. The default value is 60 seconds. |
| MPI processes              | The available range of the number of MPI processes. If you specify a number out of this range when making a run, you will get an error. |
| OMP threads                | The available range of the number of OpenMP threads. |
| Executable simulators      | List of executable simulators on that host. |
| Executable analyzers       | List of executable analyzers on that host. |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|

{% capture tips %}
If you specify *"Mounted work base dir"*, OACIS uses copy instead of SFTP to download the results from the computational host.
This may significantly improve the performance of the file transfer.
For "localhost", always specify the same value as "Work base dir". The performance will be much improved.
If the "Work base dir" on the computational host is mounted by NFS, specify the mounted path.
If the directory is not accessible from OACIS, leave it blank. 
{% endcapture %}{% include tips %}

If you find an error like *"no such command: xsub"* when registering a host, please check if XSUB is properly installed.

## [Advanced] Using the K-computer

In addition to the SSH and XSUB configurations, a special configuration is needed for the K-computer because of the staging functionality.

Since the executable file is also copied by staging, you can not specify the path to the executable by absolute path. The path changes after staging-in.
Use "preprocess" to copy the executable to the current directory and specify the simulation command using the relative path from the current directory.

Suppose your executable file is located at `~/path/to/simulator.out`. Please set the preprocess of the simulator as follows.

```shell
cp ~/path/to/simulator.out .
```

When you execute a job via xsub, the temporary directory prepared for the job is going to be staged-in. So, copy all the necessary files to the current directory in the pre-process.

Set the execution command as follows.

```shell
./simulator.out
```

By setting "command" and "pre-process" like these, we can submit jobs to the K-computer.
All the simulation results are properly staged-out if all the output files are generated in the current directory because all the files in the current directory are staged-out.

## [Advanced] Manually executing a job without using a job scheduler

If you make a Run on OACIS, the run is automatically submitted to the specified computational host by default.
However, there is an option to run it manually.
When creating a run, set the *"Submitted to"* field to *"manual submission"*. The jobs are not submitted to the remote host, but only a shell script to run the job is created.
You can execute the shell script manually and include the results into OACIS later on.

By the manual submission, you can conduct a minute customization against the job script although the submission is not automated.
The following use cases are possible for example.

- When you submit multiple runs as one bulk job.
    - If you have a strict limitation on the number of concurrent jobs, you can submit multiple runs as one big job.
- When you submit a job whose elapsed time is expected to be longer than the permitted elapsed time.
    - When the job is so long that one job execution is not enough, you need to submit jobs several times for one run.
- When a special customization to the job script is required due to the special specification of the job scheduler.
    - By manually editing the job script created by OACIS, you can fully customize it.

After you create a run of manual submission, you will find the shell script at *${OACIS_ROOT}/public/Result_development/manual_submission*.
If the simulator's input type is JSON, the input json file is also generated in the same path.

![manual submission]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/manual_submission.png){:width="400px"}

If you run the generated job script, the simulation job is executed.

```shell
bash 52cde935b93f969b07000005.sh
```

The results file (in this case 52cde935b93f969b07000005.tar.bz2) is included into OACIS by running the following command from a command-line terminal

```shell
./bin/oacis_cli job_include -i 52cde935b93f969b07000005.tar.bz2
```
